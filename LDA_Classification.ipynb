Never has so much gibberish been uttered by so many over a reflexive adjective.\\n\\nAnd there were exclamations of surprise: \\u201cHe came out against\\u00a0.\\u00a0.\\u00a0.\\u00a0bigotry!\\u201d Well, raise my rent. What did you expect him to do, endorse the vandalism of Jewish cemeteries? End Black History Month by saying, \\u201cHey, you know what, Joe Biden was right: We do want to put you back in chains!\\u201d\\n\\nPreposterous nonsense. But that is what we must expect from our increasingly ceremonial presidency. Who applauded? Who didn\\u2019t? Who was the first to stop clapping? What does it mean? It is difficult to imagine a self-respecting people\\u2019s consenting to be governed by these people, and to be condescended to by their sycophants.\\n\\nTrump was, as expected, light on policy details. It is hard to blame him.\\n\\nBut I\\u2019m up for the challenge.\\n\\nNobody wants to be the first to offer any policy specifics, because there are only two kinds of policy specifics: Those that are transparently unserious and those that are unpopular, at least among some constituency. Nobody is volunteering to put the bell on the cat.\\n\\nBut what did Trump offer instead?\\n\\nOne, a promise to significantly reduce taxes.\\n\\nTwo, a promise to significantly increase spending.\\n\\nTrump wants to increase military spending by $54 billion next year. He has proposed some offsetting cuts \\u2014 and good for him on that count \\u2014 focused largely on the State Department and diplomatic programs. These cuts are unlikely to be enacted by Congress and are opposed by many current and former military officials, who view them as a necessary complement to traditional military operations. There is room to cut at State and in USAID, but it is not obvious that a cut of 30 to 40 percent in these programs is in the best interests of the United States right now.\\n\\nBut even if we cut these to nothing, we still wouldn\\u2019t save enough to pay for what Trump is proposing in the way of tax cuts and a $1 trillion stimulus bill that nobody is calling a \\u201cstimulus\\u201d bill. (Republicans have learned to say \\u201cinfrastructure\\u201d with straight faces.) If you think Republicans are going to suddenly get serious about deep and permanent cuts to the federal apparatus, consider that Trump\\u2019s new secretary of energy, former Texas governor Rick Perry, famously wanted to shutter the department entirely\\u00a0.\\u00a0.\\u00a0.\\u00a0until about a month ago, at which time he experienced a change of heart.\\n\\nThis is going to be aggravated by Trump\\u2019s consistently repeated refusal to do anything about federal spending where the spending actually happens: in the entitlement programs.\\n\\nIf you refuse to touch entitlement spending (Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, etc.) and are intent on increasing military spending (which, arguendo, may actually need to be done) then you have put about 80 percent of the federal budget beyond the reach of any budget-cutting exercise.\\n\\nIf you refuse to touch entitlement spending and are intent on increasing military spending, then you\\u2019ve put about 80 percent of the federal budget beyond the reach of any budget-cutting exercise.\\n\\nThanks to congressional Republicans, the deficit is today much smaller than what it was during the reign of the triumvirate of Barack Obama, Harry Reid, and Nancy Pelosi, but we still run a deficit. The Congressional Budget Office projects that under current law \\u2014 which is to say, even without Trump\\u2019s proposed $1 trillion stimulus \\u2014 federal spending will grow by about 60 percent in the next ten years, driven largely by the parts of the budget that nobody wants to touch: entitlements. Federal spending as a share of GDP is expected to remain higher than its average over the last 50 years. If Republicans should decide to get rid of the unpopular parts of the Affordable Care Act (the taxes and individual mandate) and keep the popular ones (the subsidies), then you can expect that number to get even worse.\\n\\nAnd much of this assumes that the interest rates on all that federal debt stay at levels that are by historical standards unusually low. A return to the historical average would mean a Pentagon-sized hole in federal finances, and there is no reason to believe that the average is the top limit.

As reported by the New York Times, special forces attacked a village in the southern part of the country in an effort to free hostages, including an American journalist, held by jihadists. But instead of accomplishing what it set out to accomplish, the raid \\u201cended in tragedy\\u201d: Terrorists killed two hostages, including the American, and in the ensuing firefight, a number of civilians died.\\n\\nThat\\u2019s not a scandal; that\\u2019s war.\\n\\nFast-forward to late January of this year. Donald Trump, just nine days after assuming the presidency, ordered a raid into Yemen that had been planned during the Obama administration and endorsed by James Mattis, the new secretary of defense. During the attack, American forces encountered tougher-than-expected resistance, Navy SEAL Ryan Owens was killed, and civilians died in the crossfire. At the end of the attack, American and allied forces took possession of intelligence that may or may not (reports conflict) be valuable to the war against jihad.\\n\\nThat\\u2019s not a scandal; that\\u2019s war.\\n\\nBut don\\u2019t tell that to the Democrats, to the Trump administration\\u2019s most committed critics, or to multiple members of the media, including some who should know better. Suddenly, there is an odd new standard for success or failure in military operations: Special-forces raids are scandalous unless they 1) yield exactly the intelligence or other assets they sought; 2) do so without encountering unexpected resistance; and 3) do not cost any American lives.\\n\\nBy that standard, my own deployment to Iraq was one scandal after another. Even though we had boots on the ground, a consistent presence in our area of operations, and access to intelligence from a wide variety of sources, we still encountered surprises and ambushes. Multiple raids \\u201cfailed\\u201d in the sense that we didn\\u2019t seize our targets or obtain the information we had hoped to find. Our intelligence \\u201cfailed\\u201d sometimes, with inaccurate assessments of enemy capabilities or intentions leading to deaths.\\n\\nBut none of that was scandalous; it was all war.\\n\\nI\\u2019ve written at length about the Yemen raid before, but it\\u2019s vital to revisit the issue again. In part because of the profound moment in Trump\\u2019s address to Congress when he honored Carryn Owens, Ryan Owens\\u2019s widow, and in part because of his clumsy and inexcusable effort to deflect blame for Owens\\u2019s death to his generals, the Yemen raid is back in the news. And it\\u2019s thus vital to establish standards for evaluating and reporting the Trump administration\\u2019s military efforts.\\n\\nWe will never consistently have perfect knowledge, achieve perfect surprise, or obtain perfect results.\\n\\nFirst, do we really want presidents \\u2014 especially those with exactly zero military experience \\u2014 ordering individual raids in the context of ongoing military operations? Obama famously agonized over \\u201ckill lists,\\u201d reportedly even viewing the faces of targets before issuing his orders. Elevating strike authority to POTUS himself risks not only slowing down military operations, but also placing the decision in the hands of a person with less information and less experience than a professional military trained to identify and destroy our nation\\u2019s enemies.\\n\\nObama\\u2019s moral dilemmas made for good newspaper copy, but did they result in the best application of American military power? The rise of ISIS and the spread of jihad suggests that they did not.\\n\\nSecond, should Americans really have zero or near-zero tolerance for casualties? It\\u2019s a simple fact that the less we risk American forces, the less effective they are. For many good reasons, we\\u2019ve delegated much of the fight in Mosul to local allies, but that carries a cost, too. Parts of the city are still in enemy hands, and progress is slow. How much could we speed up the fight (and perhaps capture and kill more enemy fighters) if we put American soldiers closer to the action or empower them to engage the enemy directly?\\n\\nWhen soldiers enlist, they trust their commanders (including the commander-in-chief) not to throw away their lives carelessly or recklessly, but they know that they could die in the line of duty nevertheless. Americans are allegedly \\u201cwar-weary\\u201d (a strange term for a nation in which only the tiniest fraction of citizens have fought), and we\\u2019ve already suffered thousands of casualties abroad, but so long as the enemy still seeks to do us harm, we\\u2019re crippling our national defense if we unilaterally decide to fight without loss.\\n\\nThird, when terrorists use civilians as human shields, who\\u2019s to blame for the civilian deaths that result? By adopting a near-zero tolerance for civilian casualties (as the Obama administration often did), we incentivize violations of the laws of war, extend combat operations, and risk American life. When jihadists hide behind women and children, they bear the legal and moral responsibility for civilian deaths.\\n\\nThe better military policy is to delegate military decisions to military commanders, reserving presidential decision-making for significant escalations or entirely new military operations. Indeed, there\\u2019s evidence that the Trump administration is moving to exactly this command arrangement, granting General Mattis greater authority to approve missions on his own, without waiting for presidential authorization.\\n\\nJanuary\\u2019s Yemen raid was one battle in a very long conflict, a conflict that it will be increasingly difficult to fight if every engagement must end with absolute, cost-free success. We will never consistently have perfect knowledge, achieve perfect surprise, or obtain perfect results. That was not the standard of success during the Bush or Obama administrations. And it must not be the standard of success for Trump.\\n\\n\\u2014 David French is a staff writer for National Review, a senior fellow at the National Review Institute, an attorney, and a veteran of Operation Iraqi Freedom.\",\"Syria's military announced on Thursday it has fully recaptured the historic town of Palmyra from the Islamic State group as the militants' defenses crumbled.\",\"Lawmakers from both parties had urged the attorney general to recuse himself from any investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election.\",\"This week, an Amazon Web Service (AWS) failure caused a massive outage all over the internet.

Preliminary poking around indicated that there was nothing criminal involved. Rather than shut the case down, though, the Obama Justice Department converted it into a national-security investigation under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA). FISA allows the government, if it gets court permission, to conduct electronic surveillance (which could include wiretapping, monitoring of e-mail, and the like) against those it alleges are \\u201cagents of a foreign power.\\u201d FISA applications and the evidence garnered from them are classified \\u2013\\u00a0i.e., we would not know about any of this unless someone had leaked classified information to the media, a felony.\\n\\nIn June, the Obama Justice Department submitted an application that apparently \\u201cnamed\\u201d Trump in addition to some of his associates. As I have stressed, it is unclear whether \\u201cnamed\\u201d in this context indicates that Trump himself was cited as a person the Justice Department was alleging was a Russian agent whom it wanted to surveil. It could instead mean that Trump\\u2019s name was merely mentioned in an application that sought to conduct surveillance on other alleged Russian agents. President Trump\\u2019s tweets on Saturday claimed that \\u201cPresident Obama\\u00a0.\\u00a0.\\u00a0.\\u00a0tapp[ed] my phones[,]\\u201d which makes it more likely that Trump was targeted for surveillance, rather than merely mentioned in the application.\\n\\nIn any event, the FISA court reportedly turned down the Obama Justice Department\\u2019s request, which is notable: The FISA court is notoriously solicitous of government requests to conduct national-security surveillance (although, as I\\u2019ve noted over the years, the claim by many that it is a rubber-stamp is overblown).\\n\\nNot taking no for an answer, the Obama Justice Department evidently returned to the FISA court in October 2016, the critical final weeks of the presidential campaign. This time, the Justice Department submitted a narrowly tailored application that did not mention Trump. The court apparently granted it, authorizing surveillance of some Trump associates. It is unknown whether that surveillance is still underway, but the New York Times has identified \\u2013\\u00a0again, based on illegal leaks of classified information \\u2013\\u00a0at least three of its targets: Paul Manafort (the former Trump campaign chairman who was ousted in August), and two others whose connection to the Trump campaign was loose at best, Manafort\\u2019s former political-consulting business partner Roger Stone, and investor Carter Page. The Times report (from mid-January) includes a lot of heavy breathing about potential ties between the Trump campaign and Russia; but it ultimately concedes that the government\\u2019s FISA investigation may have nothing to do with Trump, the campaign, or alleged Russian efforts to interfere in the U.S. election by hacking e-mail accounts.\\n\\nTrump\\u2019s tweets on Saturday prompted some interesting \\u201cdenials\\u201d from the Obama camp. These can be summarized in the statement put out by Obama spokesman Kevin Lewis:\\n\\n\\nA cardinal rule of the Obama Administration was that no White House official ever interfered with any independent investigation led by the Department of Justice. As part of that practice, neither President Obama nor any White House official ever ordered surveillance on any U.S. citizen. Any suggestion otherwise is simply false.\\n\\n\\nThis seems disingenuous on several levels.\\n\\nFirst, as Obama officials well know, under the FISA process, it is technically the FISA court that \\u201corders\\u201d surveillance. And by statute, it is the Justice Department, not the White House, that represents the government in proceedings before the FISA court. So, the issue is not whether Obama or some member of his White House staff \\u201cordered\\u201d surveillance of Trump and his associates. The issues are (a) whether the Obama Justice Department sought such surveillance authorization from the FISA court, and (b) whether, if the Justice Department did that, the White House was aware of or complicit in the decision to do so. Personally, given the explosive and controversial nature of the surveillance request we are talking about \\u2013\\u00a0an application to wiretap the presidential candidate of the opposition party, and some of his associates, during the heat of the presidential campaign, based on the allegation that the candidate and his associates were acting as Russian agents \\u2013\\u00a0it seems to me that there is less than zero chance that could have happened without consultation between the Justice Department and the White House.\\n\\nSecond, the business about never ordering surveillance against American citizens is nonsense. Obama had American citizens killed in drone operations. Obviously, that was not done in the U.S. or through the FISA process; it was done overseas, under the president\\u2019s commander-in-chief and statutory authority during wartime. But the notion that Obama would never have an American subject to surveillance is absurd.\\n\\nThird, that brings us to a related point: FISA national-security investigations are not like criminal investigations. They are more like covert intelligence operations \\u2013\\u00a0which presidents personally sign off on. The intention is not to build a criminal case; it is to gather information about what foreign powers are up, particularly on U.S. soil. One of the points in FISA proceedings\\u2019 being classified is that they remain secret \\u2013\\u00a0the idea is not to prejudice an American citizen with publication of the fact that he has been subjected to surveillance even though he is not alleged to have engaged in criminal wrongdoing.\\n\\nConsequently, there is nothing wrong, in principle, with a president\\u2019s ordering national-security surveillance of a potential foreign agent who may be helping a foreign power threaten American security and interests. That is one of the president\\u2019s main jobs \\u2013\\u00a0there would be something wrong if a president, who truly believed the nation was threatened by a foreign power, failed to take action. Prior to FISA\\u2019s enactment in 1978, courts had no formal role in the surveillance of foreign agents for national-security purposes \\u2013\\u00a0it was a unilateral executive-branch function. Beginning with the Carter administration during FISA\\u2019s enactment, it has been the position of presidential administrations of both parties that, despite the enactment of the FISA process, the president maintains inherent authority under Article II of the Constitution to order surveillance even in the absence of court authorization.\\n\\nOf course, doing so is controversial, as President Bush learned after he directed the NSA to conduct warrantless wiretapping of suspected terrorists following the 9/11 attacks. Nevertheless, we should not allow the statements of Obama spokesmen to confuse us here. The Justice Department and FBI have two missions: (a) criminal law-enforcement and (b) national security. It would be scandalous (though probably not constitutional) for a president to interfere in the law-enforcement mission by ordering the Justice Department to prosecute someone outside its normal procedures. But it would not be inappropriate \\u00a0e\\u2013ven though civil libertarians would raise holy hell \\u2014 for the president to direct warrantless surveillance against a target, even an American citizen, if the president truly believed that target was functioning as an agent of a foreign power threatening U.S. interests.\\n\\nTo be clear, there does not seem to be any evidence, at least that I know of, to suggest that any surveillance or requests to conduct surveillance against then-candidate Donald Trump was done outside the FISA process.\\n\\nNevertheless, whether done inside or outside the FISA process, it would be a scandal of Watergate dimension if a presidential administration sought to conduct, or did conduct, national-security surveillance against the presidential candidate of the opposition party. Unless there was some powerful evidence that the candidate was actually acting as an agent of a foreign power, such activity would amount to a pretextual use of national-security power for political purposes. That is the kind of abuse that led to Richard Nixon\\u2019s resignation in lieu of impeachment.\\n\\nMoreover, it cannot be glossed over that, at the very time it appears the Obama Justice Department was seeking to surveil Trump and/or his associates on the pretext that they were Russian agents, the Obama Justice Department was also actively undermining and ultimately closing without charges the criminal investigation of Hillary Clinton despite significant evidence of felony misconduct that threatened national security.\\n\\nThis appears to be extraordinary, politically motivated abuse of presidential power.\",\"The Centre is likely to hike the dearness allowance by 2 per cent to 4 per cent for its about 50 lakh employees and 58 lakh pensioners later this month\",\"Pauline Hanson says there is a sheer hatred of Western Australian Premier Colin Barnett among voters but defends a preference deal with the state's Liberals.\",\"The New Orleans Saints have a bevy of offensive weapons littered across the depth chart, but they\\u2019re willing to part ways with one of their best.

But it was also simply an empirical observation about collective and predictable human behavior: Excess invites unexpected correction.\\u00a0\\n\\nSomething like hubris incurring Nemesis is now following the frenzied progressive effort to nullify the Trump presidency.\\n\\u00a0\\n\\nFake News\\n\\n\\u201cFake news\\u201d was a term the Left invented to describe the ancient practice of propaganda (updated in the Internet age to drive Web traffic). They applied it to the supposed Russian habit of planting international news stories to affect Western elections, and in particular Donald Trump\\u2019s campaign for the presidency and his tendencies to exaggerate and massage the truth.\\u00a0\\n\\nBut once the term caught on in our faddish age, who were the more appropriate media fakers? Fake news now serves as a sort of linguistic canary to remind the public that it is customarily saturated with a lethal gas of media disinformation.\\n\\nThus \\u201cfake news\\u201d seemed a proper if belated summation and clarification of years of liberal bias in the media that were\\u00a0supposed to be our custodian of the truth.\\n\\nWere NBC anchor Brian Williams\\u2019s fantasies fake news? Were Dan Rather\\u2019s \\u201cfake but accurate\\u201d Rathergate memos? How about the party line circulated in JournoList or the Washington and New York reporters who colluded to massage the news to favor the Clinton campaign, as revealed in the Podesta WikiLeaks trove? Was jailing a video maker part of an Obama-administration fake-news attempt to blame Benghazi deaths on a spontaneous riot? Was the Iran Deal\\u2019s \\u201cecho chamber,\\u201d about which Ben Rhodes later bragged, the epitome of fake news?\\n\\nThank the Left, because suddenly the term \\u201cfake news\\u201d is becoming a common description of the media\\u2019s effort to suggest that Trump once went to Moscow to frolic with prostitutes, that his lawyer met Russians in Prague, that he removed Martin Luther King\\u2019s bust from the Oval Office, that he was going to employ \\u201c100,000\\u201d guardsmen to enforce immigration law, or that he wished to invade Mexico.\\n\\nThe once liberal invention of the term \\u201cfake news\\u201d now mostly refers to media efforts by leftists to warp the Trump presidency; to progressive media celebrities who have been caught lying, colluding, or plagiarizing; and to the cohort of unapologetically left-wing journalists who, in the words of Obama White House operative Ben Rhodes, \\u201cknow nothing\\u201d and thus are easily manipulated by their progressive political puppeteers.\\n\\u00a0\\n\\nFake Crimes?\\n\\nIs \\u201cfake news\\u201d also the proper description for nonfactual accounts of \\u201chate crimes,\\u201d an increasingly percentage of which prove to be pure inventions (at the University of Louisiana, in North Carolina, in Santa Monica, etc.) fabricated to accord the \\u201cvictim\\u201d media attention, compensation, or sympathy?\\n\\nOr does \\u201cfake news\\u201d define the supposed epidemic of campus sexual assault, which in all too many cases involves the university\\u2019s suspension of due process and constitutional guarantees for the male accused \\u2014 who is sometimes accused because he engaged in consensual sexual relations with a female student and then socially rejected her, or because he failed to stay monogamous? In other words, \\u201csexual assault\\u201d is now redefined down to the crime of unenjoyable sexual congress, or of males proving post facto to be insincere lotharios or unreceptive cads.\\n\\u00a0\\n\\nIllegal Immigration Really Is Illegality\\n\\nIllegal immigration offers another Nemesis moment. Media outrage now surrounds almost every effort by ICE authorities to detain an illegal alien on deportation lists compiled during the Obama administration. Activists, Democratic politicians, and Mexico itself allege that the\\u00a0Trump administration is hounding the blameless, as if there were\\u00a0neither immigration law nor a concept of deportation for violations of it.\\n\\nBut usually in every media report of a victimized illegal alien, one also finds buried incidental information showing that the detainee had previously been convicted for such crimes as drunk driving, or had engaged in voting fraud, or had committed identity theft or falsified a government document, or had failed to show up for a prior deportation hearing.\\n\\nHow odd that the public is now learning that the Left apparently sees identity theft as a minor matter for illegal aliens, though a serious one for citizens.\\n\\nAll that the progressive frenzy over deportation seems to be doing is drawing attention to the quite surprising number of foreign guests who continue to live here illegally even though they have prior criminal convictions. How odd that the public is now learning that the Left apparently sees identity theft as a minor matter for illegal aliens, though a serious one for citizens. And how strange to witness entitled guests showing outrage at the possibility that they might not be allowed to enter and reside in the U.S. illegally and then commit crimes without having to worry about endangering their already illegal-resident status. \\u00a0\\n\\nThe Russian Can of Worms\\n\\nIn the latter months of the 2016 campaign, the Clinton team floated the narrative that Trump was colluding with Russian president\\u00a0Vladimir Putin, who in turn was engineering leaks to increase Trump\\u2019s unlikely chance of becoming president.\\n\\nAt first, alleging Russian collusion with Trump was a strange strategy, given that Hillary Clinton herself, as the primary agent for the Obama-administration outreach to Putin, had pushed the red Russian reset button in Geneva. And it was quite an outreach: the shelving of long-established plans to build missile-defense shields in Eastern Europe, the open-mic promise by Obama to be more flexible with Putin after Obama\\u2019s reelection, the anemic response to the de facto annexation of the Crimea and eastern Ukraine, the constant trashing of the Bush administration as too harsh on Russia, and the ridicule showered on Mitt Romney for his supposed na\\u00efvet\\u00e9 in naming Russia as America\\u2019s \\u201cNumber One geopolitical foe.\\u201d In addition, the Trump plans of encouraging domestic oil production, updating strategic weapons, and beefing up the defense budget were not agendas conducive to Russian interests. Their Obama antitheses were.\\n\\nIn addition, while the media and progressives were floating the Trump-Russian connection, it was also clear that there were all sorts of shady elements to the story that would not appear favorable to either Clinton or Obama \\u2014 from the Uranium One mess, which saw concessions given by Hillary Clinton\\u2019s State Department to Russian companies buying North American uranium, to Clinton operative John Podesta\\u2019s own investments in Russian oil concerns.\\u00a0\\n\\nWorse, the subject of election-time courting of Russia suddenly reopened the question of past Democratic electioneering gymnastics with foreign powers, such as Ted Kennedy\\u2019s efforts in 1984 to have the Russians\\u2019 help in undermining Ronald Reagan\\u2019s reelection chances, or Bill Clinton\\u2019s 1996 campaign-finance connections with China, or the Obama-designated officials\\u2019 contact, before they assumed office in 2009, with their foreign counterparts.\\u00a0\\n\\nBut Nemesis was not done. It is now reported that the Obama administration during the campaign went to a FISA court to tap the communications of Trump-campaign officials and unofficial supporters. FISA applications are almost never rejected (and never leaked), but the court rebuffed this one in June 2016, ostensibly for insufficient cause. Ostensibly it is also unprecedented for a sitting president\\u2019s administration to order surveillance of campaign personnel of an opposite party before an upcoming election \\u2014 a fact suggesting that Obama-administration officials may have assumed that a grateful shoo-in successor Clinton Justice Department would not worry greatly about such interference.\\n\\nNews reports further suggested that a frustrated Obama administration may have tried again as the campaign heated up in October 2016, may have found a more sympathetic judge, and may on the second try have begun widely tapping Trump-campaign officials.\\n\\nIn addition, the Obama administration after eight years in power suddenly and deliberately expanded the number of people granted access to such surveillance, apparently in the hope (which soon proved correct) that greater dissemination would increase the likelihood of illegal leaks that in turn would embarrass Trump.\\u00a0\\n\\nPerhaps from such intelligence leaks, the media reported that Jeff Sessions, Trump\\u2019s attorney general, had met in his office with the Russian ambassador, a supposed contradiction of his Senate testimony.\\n\\nBut then Nemesis again appeared. It turned out that almost everyone in Washington \\u2014 especially Sessions\\u2019s Democratic accusers \\u2014 had met with the Russians (most commonly Democratic senators and representatives in the spirit of the Obama-reset age).\\n\\nIndeed, Sergey Kislyak was on every Democratic powerbroker\\u2019s A list and traveled throughout the United States to meetings and conferences \\u2014 as part of accustomed outreach. Journalists had apparently forgotten that Russian officials were frequent guests at the Obama White House, a logical consequence of the then-current media narrative that cowboy George Bush had provoked Putin\\u2019s Russia, which in turn required a sober and judicious Barack Obama to calm down the class cut-up Putin and educate the macho former KGB officer about why American and Russia were in fact friends rather than enemies.\\n\\nEach time Trump impulsively raises\\u00a0controversial issues in sloppy fashion, the news cycle follows and confirms the essence of Trump\\u2019s otherwise rash warnings.\\n\\nFinally, after Democrats, Obama officials, and the media massaged the leaks from surveillance of Team Trump, in Samson-like fashion, Trump pulled down the temple on everyone \\u2014 by tweeting groundbreaking but unsupported accusations that a sitting president of the United States and his team were the catalysts for such unlawful tapping. Apparently, he reckoned that the liberal conversation would therefore turn defensive rather than accusatory. If the progressive media and intelligence agencies were hand-in-glove leaking damaging rumors about Trump, and if none were yet substantiated, then the issue reversed and turned instead on a new question: How were they trafficking in confidential intelligence information if not from skullduggery of some sort? No wonder that some smarter observers backtracked from the Russian-Trump collusion charges of the past six months, given that the leaks were less likely to be credible than they were criminal. The accusers have become the accused. And who would police the police?\\n\\nThe media and the anti-Trump Republicans decried Trump\\u2019s reckless and juvenile antics as unbefitting a president. Perhaps, but they may have forgotten Trump\\u2019s animal cunning and instincts: Each time Trump impulsively raises\\u00a0controversial issues in sloppy fashion \\u2014 some illegal aliens harm American citizens as they enjoy sanctuary-city status, NATO European partners welch on their promised defense contributions, Sweden is a powder-keg of unvetted and unassimilated immigrants from the war-torn Middle East \\u2014 the news cycle follows and confirms the essence of Trump\\u2019s otherwise rash warnings. We are learning that Trump is inexact and clumsy but often prescient; his opponents, usually deliberate and precise but disingenuous.\\n\\u00a0\\n\\nFISA-gate\\n\\nWhere are we now?\\n\\nObama officials have written contorted denials that by their very Byzantine wording suggest there is some truth to the thrust of Trump\\u2019s accusations.\\n\\nObama officials have written contorted denials that by their very Byzantine wording suggest there is some truth to the thrust of Trump\\u2019s accusations.
